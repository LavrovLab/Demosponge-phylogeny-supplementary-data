init seed : 694146

data file : fasta.nxs
number of taxa : 120
number of sites: 3626

fast computation / high memory use 

fixed tree topology: topology2.tre
outgroup : G1_G2.outgroup

branch lengths ~ iid gamma of mean mu and variance epsilon*mu^2
mu ~ exponential of mean 0.1
epsilon ~ exponential of mean 1

site homogeneous model: free equilibrium frequencies (pi inferred from data)
pi ~ uniform

relative exchange rates:
gtr (relative rates ~ iid from an exponential of mean 1)

rates ~ gamma of mean 1 and variance 1/alpha
4 discrete categories (Yang 1994)
alpha ~ exponential of mean 1

lognormal autocorrelated relaxed clock
nu ~ exponential of mean 1

calibrations : calib
soft bounds (Inoue et al 2009)
allowing for 2.5 % of probability mass outside calibration (2.5% on each side for an upper and lower bound)
lower bounds as in Paml 4.2 (truncated Cauchy), p = 0.1 and c = 1
prior on root age: gamma of mean 540 and standard deviation 540

WARNING: it is always advised to check the prior on divergence times in the presence of calibrations, by using the -prior option

prior on divergence times : birth death
birth rate : lambda
death rate : mu
sammpling fraction : rho
p1 = lambda - mu: net growth rate
p2 = lambda * rho
prior on p1 : gamma of mean 0.001 and std dev 0.001
prior on p2 : gamma of mean 0.001 and std dev 0.001
