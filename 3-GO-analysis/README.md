- `data` directory contains original and cleaned gene order 
phyles;
- `multistate-encoding` directory contains data and output 
files from ML and MP analyses based on multistate encoding 
of gene adjacencies;
- `multistate-encoding-major-genes` directory contains data 
and output files from ML and MP analyses based on multistate 
encoding relative to adjacencies to major genes. 
- `scripts` directory contains bash scripts for data 
processing and transformation.
